## [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#acceptable)

**(vii)** Apps may enable individual users to give a monetary gift to another individual without using in-app purchase, provided that (a) the gift is a completely optional choice by the giver, and (b) 100% of the funds go to the receiver of the gift. However, a gift that is connected to or associated at any point in time with receiving digital content or services must use in-app purchase.

## Usage
### `BMCButton`

[<img src="https://github.com/appcraftstudio/buymeacoffee/raw/master/Images/snapshot-bmc-button.png">](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/appcraftstudio)

`BMCButton` is a `@IBDesignable` `UIButton` subclass that comply the official Buy Me a Coffee guidelines. 
It can be customized through its `configuration` field at initialization or later if added in Interface Builder:

```swift
let button = BMCButton(configuration: .default)
button.configuraton = .init(color: .orange, font: .cookie)
```

### `BMCManager`

`BMCManager` is a singleton that is used to configure both username and presenting view controller. The username is the one you've chosen on www.buymeacoffee.com, and the presenting view controller is the one that will be used to present donation flow when user tap on the `BMCButton`.
It can be configured in the `viewDidLoad` function:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    BMCManager.shared.username = "appcraftstudio"
    BMCManager.shared.presentingViewController = self
}
```
